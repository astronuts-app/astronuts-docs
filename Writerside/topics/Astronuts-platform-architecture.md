The [Astronuts](https://www.astronuts.io/) platform is a multi-tenant platform
that runs on a multi-cloud infrastructure for maximum availability.
The platform is built on a microservices architecture and is designed from the ground up to be scalable,
secure, and reliable, highly available and fault-tolerant, with <b>no single point of failure</b>.

An <b>active-active</b>, zero downtime deployment strategy is used to ensure that the platform is always available.
Advanced load-balancing and auto-scaling techniques are used
to ensure that the platform can handle varying loads and <b>scales elastically</b>.
All components of the platform scale independently.


## Core components {id="astronuts-core-components"}

* <b>Core platform:</b> Astronuts is built around a auto-scaling core component that is designed to facilitate a pluggable and extensible deployment model. All future products and capabilities would be built as microservices that can be plugged into the core platform. Each microservice is designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable. State management is delegated to the core platform.
  
* <b>Third party apps:</b> A superior user experience and seamless integration is afforded by third party apps built for popular products and platforms like Slack, GitHub, Jira etc. These apps ate available in the respective marketplaces, e.g., the [Astronuts GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/astronuts-app).
  
* <b>User facing apps:</b> User facing applications like the [Astronuts Dashboard](https://dashboard.astronuts.io/) allow users to manage their account, configure various Astronuts products and services and view reports and analytics.

* <b>Persistence layer:</b> The persistence layer is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. Multi-availability zone ensures that multiple copies of data are stored in different availability zones. The persistence layer is designed to be horizontally scalable and can handle large volumes of data. 

* <b>AI Engine:</b> Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are the cornerstone of the Astronuts platform. Most of Astronuts' product capabilities rely heavily on the AI engine.

* <b>Vector databases:</b> Vector databases are used to store embeddings generated by the AI engine. These embeddings are used for similarity search, clustering, and other AI capabilities. The vector databases are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant and scale independently.

* <b>Large Language Models:</b> Self hosted (private) large language models are used to ensure privacy and data protection for customers. These models are trained on a variety of data sources and are fine-tuned for specific use cases. Helped by RAG, these models are used to generate text, answer questions, and provide recommendations. Currently, a variety of Large Language Models are leveraged, e.g., GPT-4, which run private instances on <b>Microsoft Azure</b>.


## Cloud infrastructure and best practices {id="astronuts-cloud-infrastructure"}

* <b>Multi-cloud:</b> Astronuts is deployed on multiple cloud providers to ensure maximum availability and fault tolerance. The platform is currently deployed on Azure, and AWS. Our decision to use specific cloud services from public cloud providers like AWS and Azure is based on the specific requirements of the platform and the capabilities of the cloud provider.

* <b>Regions and availability zones:</b> Astronuts is deployed in multiple regions and availability zones to ensure maximum availability and fault tolerance. The platform is currently deployed in multiple regions across the globe, including North America, Europe, and Asia.

* <b>Load balancing:</b> Advanced load balancing techniques are used to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the platform. Load balancing ensures that the platform can handle varying loads and scales elastically.

* <b>Auto-scaling:</b> Auto-scaling techniques are used to automatically adjust the number of instances of the platform based on the current load. Auto-scaling ensures that the platform can handle varying loads and scales elastically.

* <b>Monitoring and alerting:</b> Comprehensive monitoring and alerting are in place to ensure that the platform is always available. Monitoring and alerting tools are used to monitor the health of the platform and alert the operations team in case of any issues.

* <b>Security:</b> Security is a top priority for Astronuts. The platform is designed to be secure by default and follows industry best practices for security. Security features like encryption, access control, and data protection are built into the platform. We employ security for both data at rest and data in transit.

* <b>Compliance:</b> Astronuts is designed to be compliant with industry standards and regulations. The platform is designed to be compliant with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations. Compliance features like data protection, access control, and audit logging are built into the platform.

* <b>Disaster recovery:</b> Astronuts follows a disaster recovery strategy. Backups are taken regularly, and disaster recovery plans are in place to ensure that the platform can recover quickly in case of a disaster.

## Engineering best practices {id="astronuts-engineering-practices"}

* <b>Microservices:</b> Astronuts is built on a <b>microservice</b> architecture. Each microservice is designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable. Microservices communicate with each other using APIs and are deployed independently.

* <b>Continuous integration and deployment:</b> Astronuts follows a <b>continuous integration and deployment</b> model. Changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. This ensures that new features and bug fixes can be delivered quickly and reliably.

* <b>Version control:</b> Astronuts uses <b>Git</b> for version control. All code changes are tracked in Git, and changes are reviewed and merged using pull requests. This ensures that changes are tracked and can be rolled back if necessary.

* <b>Code quality:</b> Astronuts follows industry best practices for code quality. Code reviews, linting, and automated testing are used to ensure that code is of high quality and free of bugs.

* <b>Documentation:</b> Astronuts places a high emphasis on documentation. Documentation is written for all code changes, APIs, and architecture decisions. This ensures that the platform is well-documented and easy to understand.

* <b>Testing:</b> Astronuts follows a comprehensive testing strategy. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are used to ensure that the platform is reliable and free of bugs. Automated testing is used to ensure that new features do not introduce regressions.

* <b>Multiple environments:</b> Astronuts follows a multiple environment strategy. Changes are deployed to development, staging, and production environments. This ensures that changes are tested thoroughly before being deployed to production. All environments work in a similar way to production and employ a 'share-nothing' strategy.

* <b>Polyglot systems:</b> Astronuts uses a variety of programming languages and technologies. The platform is built using the best tool for the job, and new technologies are evaluated regularly. This ensures that the platform is flexible and can adapt to changing requirements. Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, Scala, Java, and Go are some of the languages used. 

* <b>State of the art frameworks:</b> Astronuts uses the newest frameworks and libraries. This ensures we devote the maximum time to building features and not maintaining legacy code. We use the best tools for the job, and new technologies are evaluated regularly.

## Technology roadmap {id="astronuts-technology-roadmap"}

* <b>AI capabilities:</b> Astronuts is constantly improving its AI capabilities. New AI models, algorithms, and techniques are evaluated and integrated into the platform. The AI engine is continuously improved to provide better recommendations, generate better text, and answer questions more accurately.

* <b>Architecture review and refresh cycle:</b> Astronuts follows a regular architecture review and refresh cycle. The platform is continuously evaluated for performance, scalability, and reliability. New technologies and best practices are integrated into the platform to ensure that it remains state of the art.

* <b>Customer focus and business drivers:</b> Astronuts is driven by customer feedback and business requirements. New features and capabilities are developed based on customer feedback and business requirements. The platform is continuously improved to meet the needs of our customers.
