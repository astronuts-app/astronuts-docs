## Introduction {id="slack-app-intro"}

The Slack app for Astronuts is a powerful way
to keep your team in sync with the latest updates on your products and services.
It also delivers real time messages and notifications to your Slack workspace.
Certain products like [Error Monitoring](Error-monitoring.md) rely on Slack for functioning.

If you don't use Slack in your organization, you don't need to connect it with Astronuts.
In that case some features of Astronuts might be unavailable to you,
especially those which rely on Slack for functioning.
