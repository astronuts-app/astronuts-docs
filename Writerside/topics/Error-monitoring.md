Astronuts provides real-time resolutions of errors observed in your application server logs. Combined with capabilities afforded by the [Slack app for Astronuts](Slack-app.md), [AI training](Setup-AI-Training.md), and the [GitHub app for Astronuts](GitHub-app.md), Astronuts provides a comprehensive solution for error monitoring.

Using the rich body of knowledge that you build in Astronuts by connecting your tools and processes,
