# Navigation

Navigating your Dashboard is intuitive, easy and follows a consistent pattern.
It's based on well researched human interface design that you will find familiar and easy to use.

## Sidebar Navigation

The Dashboard sidebar provides top level navigation to all the products and services you have access to. Click on each sidebar item to access a product or service.

  <p>The sidebar can be collapsed by clicking the hamburger menu icon in the top left corner of the screen.

## Tabbed Pages
Almost all pages in the dashboard are tabbed.
This allows you to access different parts of a top level page seamlessly without losing context.
Clicking each tab element will display the content associated with that tab.

While accessing the dashboard, on devices with smaller screens, the tabs will be displayed as a dropdown menu.
