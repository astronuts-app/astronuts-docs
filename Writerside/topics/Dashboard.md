# Dashboard

The [Astronuts Dashboard](https://dashboard.astronuts.io/login) is your cockpit from where
you can manage your Astronuts account and access all the products and services.
Here you can configure your profile, manage your subscriptions, invite team members, and more.
Not all products in the Astronuts suite are accessed using the dashboard.
But you can get a birds eye view of all your Astronuts products and services from here.

To access your Astronuts dashboard,
open a browser window and go to [https://dashboard.astronuts.io/](https://dashboard.astronuts.io/).
