# Connect Slack


To connect Astronuts with your **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** workspace, take the following steps.
This example assumes that you have the authority to install apps in your organizational SLack workspace.
You can create a Slack workspace for free at [https://slack.com/](https://slack.com/).

<tip>
    <p>
        If you don't use Slack yet, you don't need to connect it with Astronuts.
        In that case some features of Astronuts might be unavailable to you,
        especially those which rely on Slack for functioning. 
    </p>
    <p>
    When your Slack is not connected with Astronuts,
    we deliver real-time messages related to the products and services you setup via other means like email and web notifications.

                Your ability
                to install the Astronuts app for Slack on your organizational Slack workspace may be limited by the number of apps you are allowed
                to install on Slack.
                This is typically determined by your Slack subscription plan you are on.
                If you are unable to install the Astronuts app,
                you may need to contact your Slack workspace administrator to install the app for you.
